            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <img src="Images/IMG_6204.JPG" class="bioPic">
            <p class="bioPara">As a developer, I’ve faced many different challenges throughout my career. Originally, I’d never decided on being a computer scientist, rather a lawyer. From a young age, I was captivated by computers and everything that they did. Yet, I was often left with a burning question in the back of my head: “How do they do it?”.</p>
            <p class="bioPara">All of this remained an enigma until I took my first computer science course in 2014. Creating websites, styling them, adding interactive items, and even learning javascript to some extent captivated my interest. It wasn’t until I opened up IDLE and started using Python that I’d truly begun my journey.</p>
            <p class="bioPara">Soon, the basis of python wasn’t enough for me, so I started studying libraries. Tkinter was an obvious first choice, and Pygame not long after. Over the next seven years, I started studying everything, from Unity and the C family, to Java and even some basic Assembly programming.</p>
            <p class="bioPara">Inevitably, after learning all I could about the fundamentals of computer science and the inner workings of a computer, I simplified my interests. Instead, returning to where I came from, web development.</p>
            <p class="bioPara">Since then, I’ve been working simultaneously to bridge the gap between server management and web development in my skillset, namely studying the WAMP architecture (Windows, Apache, MySQL, PHP).</p>
            <p class="bioPara">While I have aspirations of gaining my masters in Computer Science in the future, short-term, I’m looking for employment as an intern to learn more about both web development and software development.</p>
